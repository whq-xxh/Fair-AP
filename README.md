# Fair-AP
Toward Fair and Accurate Cross-Domain Medical Image Segmentation: A VLM-Driven Active Domain Adaptation Paradigm

Thanks for your interest. Code is organizing and will be released.


# How to Run the Code 🛠
### Environment Installation
### 1. Training source models in the source center
For setting up the environment and training the source model, please refer to the [[STDR]](https://github.com/whq-xxh/SFADA-GTV-Seg) project. Please note that some hyperparameters, such as the image input resolution, may need to be adjusted.

### 2. Fair-AP strategy 


### 3. Finetune the source Model with actively enhanced-pseudo labels 
Please refer to the [[STDR]](https://github.com/whq-xxh/SFADA-GTV-Seg) project.
